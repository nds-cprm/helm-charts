  MapServer is an Open Source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web. 
  Originally developed in the mid-1990â€™s at the University of Minnesota, MapServer is released under an MIT-style 
  license, and runs on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X). MapServer is not a full-featured GIS system, 
  nor does it aspire to be.
